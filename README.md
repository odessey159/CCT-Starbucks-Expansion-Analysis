CCT – Starbucks China Expansion Strategy Analysis
Overview:
This project was developed as part of the 2023 CCT Business Case Competition. Our team analyzed Starbucks’ expansion strategy in China, focusing on second-tier cities. We conducted data-driven research on store layout, pricing structure, customer segmentation, and competitive dynamics. Based on these insights, we proposed a multi-dimensional strategy covering offline expansion, IP collaboration, digital integration, and product line innovation.
